# sortestJobFirst
This program is show that which process execute first and then which process is done according to shortest job first algorithms. 


if we inserted 20 prcess with arrival time , burst time with the process number the we get result. thay=t result show that which process execute first and then which process done and so on.

Output will show in order.

That order show that first process which done and then which.
